## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is meant to be a fast render engine, written from scratch mainly in C++. It uses no external libraries, and in its final stage, will be a complete rendering pipeline with no external dependencies (to reduce the pain C++ library system induces in ones rear) and completely self contained from generating assets to the final render. The project is still in a very early phase, case in point only a single tri has been rendered reliably.

This project uses the <a href = "https://github.com/stealthypanda/hermes">hermes build system</a>.
<!-- ## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a> -->
<!-- ### Prerequisites
This library is self contained, and optionally uses matplotlib for plotting graphs.

### Installing
This library can be installed from pypi using pip:


```
$ pip install buffinc
```

To make sure everything installed properly, import the main and only module in python:

```
from quantum import * -->

<!-- ## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example

<!-- 
## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
*Go through example.ipynb for a comprehensive guide on using this library*

Sample workflow:

```
entangler = qprogram(
    nqbits = 2,
    name = "Entangler"
)
entangler.addgates(0, [HGATE, CNOT0])
entangler.compile()
```
Compiler result:
```
Compiling Entangler...

Entangler
q0(0) ⮕  -----[ h ]--⌈ c0 c0 ⌉-------
q1(0) ⮕  ------------⌊ c0 c0 ⌋-------


Compilation of Entangler complete!
```

and to run the program:

```
entangler.run(graph = True)
```
![graph](./docs/graph.png)

and view bloch spheres for qubits:
```
plotbloch(HGATE * [0, 1])
```
